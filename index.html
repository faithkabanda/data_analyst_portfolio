									<p>Project Summary: A company has various clients who are required to provide regular updates of their actions, setbacks and progress in the form of income reports, account details, expense reports, loans taken  reports as well as loans given reports. This projects extracts all raw data reports of all participating firms in 3 different cities in Zimbabwe: Bulawayo, Gweru and Mutare. The objectives are to utilize Python and MS Excel to investigate rates at which information is provided, its validity and identify firms that have queries that need to be resolved. Data cleaning, wrangling and consolidation is done in Python whilst exploratory data analysis and output report generation are completed in MS Excel.</p>

									<p>Project Summary: A candy shop in Zimbabwe makes and distributes candy across the country. The new sales manager requested an MS Excel dataset of the sales from 2020 to 2021 in order to have an understanding of how well the candy shop was doing before she came on board. The candies and snacks are distributed to four cities, namely: Bulawayo, Victoria Falls, Mutare and Harare. The candies and snacks ae grouped into 4 categories, namely: Bars, Crackers, Cookies and Snacks. Python is used to authenticate, create and update Google Sheets file. In addition, graphs are generated in order make use of data vizualization to present the findings.  </p>

									<p>Project Summary: A game enthusiast is interested in one day opening a gaming store. The game enthusiast carried out some market research and would like to know what impacts and influences game sales. The game enthusiast gained access to game sales from North America, Europe, Japan and the rest of the world in millions of US dollars from 1981 to 2020. The first stage involved cleaning and transforming the data in preparation for Exploratory Data Analysis.</p>

									<p>Project Summary: A Director at a theoretical small Zimbabwean law firm is concerned about employee absenteeism among staff. She believes that organisation commitment is probably the most significant contributing factor. She selected a random sample of 31 employee files and noted their level of absenteeism (in days p.a.). She sent a confidential questionnaire to each of the selected employees from which an organisation commitment index was derived. The Director is interested in the possible effect that other factors such as job tenure (time in months at the organisation), and grade (1 = clerk, 2 = consultant, 3 = lawyer) have on the level of employee absenteeism. Multiple linear regression of the data with commitment, job tenure and grade as independent variables is used to help the Director understand truely, which factors are contributing to employees’ absenteeism. NB: For the variable grade, two dummy variables were used.</p>

									<p>Project Summary: The data sorted, cleaned and consolidated in project 1 above will be vizualized through Dash Apps in Python, Power Bi, Tableau, Looker (Google Data Studio) and Microsoft Power Point through R and R studio to show case various data vizualization methods. Identifying of patterns, trends and outliers in the above large data set will be achieved through the use of graphs, tables and more. Data visualization, as one of the final steps of the data science process, will be carried out in order for conclusions to be made. The data vizualization will be done through easy-to-communicate and easy-to-understand graphic or visual representation. Firsly, in R, the data was cleaned and made ready for analysis. For example, by correcting the currency column name to "Order_Quantity" instead of just "Quantity" (typing error by data collectors), setting variables to the correct formats such as numeric and date, and so on. A powerpoint presentaion was then generated using R markdown.</p>
